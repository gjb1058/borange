Borange uses a basic system for terminal style graphics that 
allows you to even create your own textures. This document
goes over the details and proper procedures used by the game
to display textures.


The Information Section

The information section of the file details the file name,
the author of the file, and the size of the file. The
section is then separated from the textures via equal
signs. This section is specifically 4 lines long.

Information Section Example:

FILE:   cube.txt
AUTHOR: Billy Cubeman
SIZE:   3 x 3
=====================


The Texture Section

This section specifies what characters will be displayed
on the screen. Include spaces for non used area. This
section should follow immediately after the information
section, starting on line 5.

Texture Section Example:
=======================
+-+
|O|
+-+

The Color Section

The color section specifies the foreground then the 
background colors that will be displayed for the graphics.
Each section should be one space apart from the next one.
For color coding, check types.h for the colors supported
under the SCOLOR enum.
